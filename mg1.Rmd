## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.



```{r}
plot(a1$pos, a1$bayesian_add_log10_bf, ylim = c(0, 10), main = "Post-QC log10 BFs", xlab =
       "position", ylab = "log10 BF")
```

```{r}
a1[which(a1$bayesian_add_log10_bf > 3),c(1,2,4)]
```



```{r}
plot(a2$pos, a2$bayesian_add_log10_bf, ylim = c(0, 10), main = "Post-QC log10 BFs", xlab =
       "position", ylab = "log10 BF")
```
```{r}
a2[which(a2$bayesian_add_log10_bf > 3), c(1,2,4)]
```

```{r}

```





```{r}
plot(a3$pos, -log10(a3$P_value), ylab = "-log10 p-value")
```
